# Amazon_Sales_Data Analysis
Hello everyone,

I am excited to share with you my project on Amazon sales data analysis! As part of my internship with Unified Mentor, I had the opportunity to work on this project and gain valuable insights into analyzing sales data.

In this project, I used Python to analyze Amazon sales data and created visualizations to better understand trends and patterns. 

I had a great time working on this project and learned a lot in the process. I hope it inspires you to dive into data analysis and explore the insights that can be gained from it.
